# Snake_BGI
Siddharth Chandrasekar, 2016

A snake game program written using C++ using the WinBGI graphics.h library.

This is probably one of the best WinBGI snake implementations you'll find online (Believe me, I've looked). I've implemented a concept called 
double buffering to make the gameplay much smoother.

To run the application, make sure you have the WinBGI library installed. It will only work on Windows computers.

Please do not copy my work. If you'd like to use it for reference, please make sure to cite it as a source when you submit your
assignment/project. I'll know if you've used my code, so don't think you're getting away with anything :-P
