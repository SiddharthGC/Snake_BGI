# Snake_BGI
Siddharth Chandrasekar, 2016

A snake game program written in C++ using the WinBGI graphics.h library.

This is probably one of the best WinBGI snake implementations you'll find online (Believe me, I've looked). I've implemented a concept called 
double buffering to make the gameplay much smoother.

To run the application, make sure you have the WinBGI library installed. It will only work on Windows computers.
